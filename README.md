# STM32-Peripherals
This repository contains my STM32 codes in order to use some useful peripherals. 

This repository contains these peripherals:
 - ADC
 - Counter
 - DAC
 - External Interrupt
 - GPIO
 - LCD
 - PWM
 - RTC
 - SPI
 - Timer
 - UART

Thanks to Mr. Hamid Najafi, my first STM32 and programming instructor.
I learned STM32 coding from him in 2017.
